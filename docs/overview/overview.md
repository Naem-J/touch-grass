# Touch Grass API Overview

The Touch Grass service is a REST API that provides information about state and national parks in California. It also maintains visitor profiles to match similar subscribers with potential park destinations.

### Great for Explorers

California is home to 280 state parks [^1] and 9 national parks (the most of any other state) [^2]. With over a million acres of parks, it can be daunting find the parks you should prioritize for your personal preferences or tendencies. The Touch Grass API organizes these preferences and tendencies into profiles (`visitors`) to help match you with parks that share similar traits.

### Motivate Yourself to Go Outside or Somewhere New

Go out and touch grass somewhere new in nature. The Touch Grass API helps reduce stress related to research and decision fatigue.
